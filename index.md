## Introduction

Hello.  I am the Senior AI Engineer at Capco Digital Labs -- NYC.  I have my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ.  I primarily use TensorFlow as a ML framework for neural networks while using `scikit-learn` for other algorithms.

Before I was at Capco I ran R&D for Elemental Path, a smart toy / conversational AI startup, building speech-to-text systems, speaker recognition systems, and a curated knowledge engine for fast / safe lookups for serving information for users of the system.
